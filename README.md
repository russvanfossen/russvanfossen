### Hi there 👋
#### Welcome to my GitHub page.
Most of my projects are tools I've used at various times at various places. They're not much, but they're honest work 👨‍🌾 (aka mostly copied from stackoverflow). <br>
I use python mostly. I've leared VB and VBS mostly out of necessity. I've also dabbled in many other languages as needed. I'm always looking to add new skills. <br>
